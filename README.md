## About This Repository

Due to historical reasons, **only the localization files are hosted in this public repository**. The rest of the addon's source code remains private for now.

EXBoss launched relatively late this season and grew much faster than anticipated, which left some architectural debt. If you have questions about the addon's internal code, feel free to contact the author directly — we are happy to discuss it.

We are planning a significant architectural refactor in **patch 12.1**, at which point we will reorganize the repository structure and revisit what can be made public. Thank you for your patience and understanding.
